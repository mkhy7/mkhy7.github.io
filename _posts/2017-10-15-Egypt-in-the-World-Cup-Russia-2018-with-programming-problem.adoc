=== Yes Egypt in the World Cup
Last Sunday, the Egyptian team beat the Congo and qualified to the 2018 World Cup after draw Ghana with Uganda +
In the night of the most beautiful nights Egypt lived for a full of joy and happiness day. Everyone was happy.

As for me, it was the most beautiful day of my life since I was born. It is not only for us that we win, but because I have had a great experience from the Burj Al Arab Stadium in Alexandria.

*What happened with me is..* +
On the Friday before last October 6th I traveled from Minia in Upper Egypt to Cairo to prepare to travel on sunday morning to Alexandria
When I arrived in Cairo I went with my friend to get tickets from our friends who were ready to go with us and ended on saturday.

On Sunday we traveled to Alexandria from 7:00 am, and at 2 pm we arrived at the Burj Al Arab Stadium in Alexandria. We waited the match which will start at 7 pm in a great scene for the Egyptian audience. 

At seven the match started and everyone was on the nerves. Personally, I was very nervous I was sitting between the stands and above the chair and encouraged with the fans.

The most powerful chant was the "World Cup" in arabic, "Yarb" means God and "Masr" means Egypt. +
The first half of the match ended with a draw and increased concern.

In fact we do not play good football, We defend fairly well and kill the match and depend on Mohamed Salah to come with the goal of winning.

In the second half and during the first quarter the ball came to Salah from Elneny and finished in the goal and here caught the stands.
Yes, it was a great sight in a great stadium filled with more than 90,000 spectators.

The truth was that we were on our nerves and no one wanted to sit on the chairs except those who are older than us. They used to ask the young people to sit down and watch the match, but it soon ended when one of the ladies told the young men "Sit down, Egypt is gladness". 

But when the youth sat, It was in the 85th minute and in the 87th minute the Congolese enabled to score a deadly goal to end the hopes of more than 100 million Egyptians. +
No one speaks. As you are in the desert lonely or desperate in your room at night. +
I noticed after the goal every thing in stadium, The faces of fans, The tears, Players, Coaches And even security. +
Also noticed Salah when he dropped his face on the ground.

But inside I felt that this would not happen. We will not fail and we will not grieve and we will win.
I was optimistic and I don't know why?!

In extra time Trezeguet enabled to get a penalty kick and scored by Salah to finish the game and qualify Egypt to the World Cup.

I am pleased that I have lived all the moments with the Egyptian team in the hardest match since 28 years. +
Yes, Football makes me happy because it is a practical field that helps in raising the homelands, such as engineering, programming, medicine, astronomy and philosophy.
Yes, I am happy because our team has succeeded and gone up regardless of performance.
Happy for the joy of my countrymen.

Yes, that day will never forget and will always remind my friends

After the end of the match, I thought about Egyptian team problem and wrote it and the technique how we play 

I think you can solve it, It's simple. Solve it and tell me about your code and your opinion.

And if it has a mistake you can message me at any time and I will be happy with this.

== Egypt to Russia
This week egypt will play the fifth match with congo, Egypt need to win to qualify to World Cup in Russia 2018.
But through the four matches before, Egypt won Congo in Congo 2-1 ,Ghana in Egypt 2-0 then Egypt losses from Uganda in Uganda 1-0 then Egypt won in Egypt 1-0.
And now Egypt have 9 points then Uganda with 8 points then Ghana with 6 points then Congo with one point.

Egyptian fans notice that Mohamed Salah is the most player scores goals or assist goals but how it is the technique?

The head coach Hector Koober depend on salah, the ball starts move from the goalkeeper Essam Elhadary then go to Ahmed Higazay or Ali Gabr (defenders)
then to Abd Elshafy or Ahmed Fathi then move to Tarek Hamed or Elneny.
And here is the problem the ball go back to defender Higazy or Gabr.

It's suppose to move to the goal makers Elsaid or Salah or Trezeguet to help their striker Koka to score goals and this does not happened.

So ball must reach to Elsaid or salah or trezeguet to make an dangerous impact for the second team so you must count how many goals Egyptian team can score with their attackers.
And if the ball reach to Elsaid or salah or trezeguet you must identify if the attackers scored the goal or not.

Strikers can not score goals in Koober technique and all goals by the midfielders.

*Input Format*
The first line contains an integer, N denoting number of attacking that starts from Essam Elhadary.
Then N lines in each line list of ones or zeros (1 indicates to the ball moved from level to another level) or 0(if not).
And if the ball reach to last level (midfielders) you must identify if the ball scored goal or not (y or n).

*Output Format*
Count how many goals Egyptian team can score when thay attack.

*Notice: No Constraints 

*Sample Input*

8 +
1 1 1 0 +
1 1 1 1 n  +  
1 1 1 0 +   
1 1 1 1 n +   
1 1 1 1 y +
1 1 1 1 y +
1 1 1 0 +
1 1 1 1 y +       

*Sample Output* +
