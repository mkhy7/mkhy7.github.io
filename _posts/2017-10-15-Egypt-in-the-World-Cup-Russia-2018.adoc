=== Yes Egypt in the World Cup
Last Sunday, the Egyptian team beat the Congo and qualified to the 2018 World Cup after draw Ghana with Uganda

In the night of the most beautiful nights Egypt lived for a full of joy and happiness day. Everyone was happy.

As for me, it was the most beautiful day of my life since I was born. It is not only for us that we win, but because I have had a great experience from the Burj Al Arab Stadium in Alexandria.

What happened with me is..

On the Friday before last October 6th I traveled from Minia in Upper Egypt to Cairo to prepare to travel on sunday morning to Alexandria
When I arrived in Cairo I went with my friend to get tickets from our friends who were ready to go with us and ended on saturday.

On Sunday we traveled to Alexandria from 7:00 am, and at 2 pm we arrived at the Burj Al Arab Stadium in Alexandria. We waited the match which will start at 7 pm in a great scene for the Egyptian audience
At seven.

The match started and everyone was on the nerves. Personally I was very nervous I was sitting between the stands and above the chair and encouraged with the fans.

The most powerful chant was the World Cup, "Yarb" means God and "Egypt"

The first half of the match ended with a draw and increased concern

In fact we do not play good football, We defend fairly well and kill the match and depend on Mohamed Salah to come with the goal of winning.

In the second half and during the first quarter the ball came to Salah from Elneny and finished in the goal and here caught the stands.
Yes, it was a great sight in a great stadium filled with about 90,000 spectators.

The truth was that we were on our nerves and no one wanted to sit on the chairs except those who are older than us. They used to ask the young people to sit down and watch the match, but it soon ended when one of the ladies told the young men "Sitdown, Egypt happy".

But when the youth sat, It was in the 85th minute and in the 87th minute the Congolese enabled to score a deadly goal to end the hopes of more than 100 million Egyptians. 
No one speaks. As you are in the desert lonely or desperate in your room at night.

I noticed after the goal every thing in stadium, The faces of fans, Players, coaches and even security.

Also noticed Salah when he caught a face in the ground and noticed the tears.

But inside I felt that this would not happen. We will not fail and we will not grieve and we will win.
I was optimistic.

In extra time Trezeguet enable to get a penalty kick and scored by Salah to finish the game and qualify Egypt to the World Cup.

I am pleased that I have lived all the moments with the Egyptian team in the hardest match since 28 years.

Yes football make me a happy because it is a practical field that helps in raising the homelands, such as engineering, programming, medicine, astronomy and philosophy.
Yes, I am happy because our team has succeeded and gone up regardless of performance.
Happy for the joy of my countrymen.

Yes, that day will never forget and will always remind my friends

After the end of the match, I thought about Egyptian team problem and wrote it and the technique we play

If you can solve it, solve it and tell me about your code.
And if it has a mistake you can call me at any time and I will be happy with this.
